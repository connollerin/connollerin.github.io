### Career/School

I'm from Atlanta, GA and currently attend Dartmouth College as an undergraduate. I'm double majoring in Computer Science and Economics, and I am exploring the many different options of career paths. I'm interested in business consulting, software engineering, real estate, startups, you name it. Until I figure out what I want to do with my life, I'm going to keep learning as much as possible and getting to know all kinds of people while at school.

### Hobbies

At Dartmouth, I am a member of the Club Triathlon Team, and I love to run. I also enjoy yoga and hiking in the mountains around Vermont and New Hampshire. I am proficient in French and am excited to study abroad in Paris in the Spring of 2016. I can't wait to travel and spend time in a different part of the world.
