### Career/School

I'm from Atlanta, GA and currently attend Dartmouth College as an undergraduate. I'm double majoring in Computer Science and Economics, and I am exploring the many different options of career paths. I'm interested in business, mainly consulting and real estate, but also I really enjoy coding and would love to explore project and product management roles. In the end, I want to work with good people who care about what they're doing.

### Hobbies

At Dartmouth, I am a member of the Club Triathlon Team, and I love to run. I also enjoy yoga and hiking in the mountains around Vermont and New Hampshire. I am proficient in French and am excited to study abroad in Paris in the Spring of 2016.
